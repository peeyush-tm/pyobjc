the C and Objective-C APIs are available (but see the `API Notes`_ below).

API Notes
---------

The full API for the SpriteKit framework is available from Python, except for methods that have a
vector_float3 as one of their arguments or as a return value (those require changes to PyObjC's core
bridge).

.. note::

   This framework is only available on OSX 10.9 and later and requires a 64-bit binary.
