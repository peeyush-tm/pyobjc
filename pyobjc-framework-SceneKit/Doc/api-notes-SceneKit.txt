API Notes
---------

The full API for the SceneKit framework is available from Python, except for methods that have a
vector_float3 or vector_float4 as one of their arguments or as a return value (those require changes
to PyObjC's core bridge).

.. note::

   This framework is only available on OSX 10.8 and later.
