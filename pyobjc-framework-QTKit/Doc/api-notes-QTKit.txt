API Notes: QTKit framework
==========================

API Notes
---------

* Functions ``QTMakeTimeWithTimeRecord`` and ``QTGetTimeRecord`` are not
  supported.

* The integration with classical Quicktime API is not properly tested at the
  moment.  Furthermore that API is deprecated by Apple, and not available
  in 64-bit code. Use the QTKit API where possible.

.. note::

   This framework is deprecated in OSX 10.9, use the AVKit and AVFoundation
   frameworks instead.
