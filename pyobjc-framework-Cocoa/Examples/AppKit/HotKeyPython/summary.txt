Demonstrates how to use Carbon global hot keys from a PyObjC
application. Also demonstrates how to use a ``NSApplication``
subclass.

.. note::

   Requires Python 2.x because the code uses the Carbon package
   that was removed in Python 3.0.

   Not only that, you need to run the example in 32-bit mode as
   well because some of the Carbon function's aren't available
   in 64-bit mode.
